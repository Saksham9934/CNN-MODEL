Project Title: CNN Model for Skin Cancer Detection, Classification, Training And Quantitaive Results...

Description:
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect and classify skin cancer using Python programming in Jupyter Notebook. The model aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, improving patient outcomes.

Features:

- Implementation of a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training and testing on a dataset of skin cancer images
- Classification into different types of skin cancer
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

I am looking to collaborate on:

- Improving the model's accuracy and performance
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse skin cancer images
- Integrating the model into a web application or mobile app for real-world use
- Exploring transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models for better results

Contributions:

- Bug fixes and code improvements
- New feature implementations (e.g., data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning)
- Documentation and README updates

Getting Started:

- Clone the repository and install required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model
- Explore the code and contribute your ideas!
